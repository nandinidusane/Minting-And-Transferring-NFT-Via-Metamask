# Minting And Transferring NFT Via Metamask
 
To mint and transfer an NFT, follow these steps:

Start by creating an NFT from scratch using the ERC721 standard.
Utilize tools like OpenZeppelin, IPFS, web3.js, ether.js, Alchemy, and Pinta during the process. No front-end integration is required for this.
Once you've created the NFT, obtain the Transaction Hash and enter it on Gorila Test Etherscan.
After entering the Transaction Hash, you will receive an Interacted With (To) address.
Take this address and enter it in the MetaMask NFT section along with the token ID that was minted successfully.
With the minted NFT in MetaMask, you can now transfer it to another account.
Use MetaMask to complete the transfer process.

Since it is not hosted yet, I have attached screenshots of the working process for reference.
Account 1 contains NFT #3 and #4.
After Transfer From Account 1 To Account 2 Contain NFT #3
